First step is to scan the machine:

nmap -vvvv -sC -sV -p- -T4 MACHINE_IP

This reveals a few open ports, several of which are very common. Namely, 21 (ftp), 22 (ssh) and 80 (http).

Notably, the FTP server allows anonymous login. Connecting to it, we find two files, password-policy.md and ufw.status.
We learn from the password policy that the password must be between 11 and 13 characters and all lowercase.
We also learn from ufw.status that port 8080 is also open, and navigating to it in a browser gives us a login page. Score.

A directory enumeration of port 80 in Gobuster reveals robots.txt, which contains Flag 1.

On the homepage of port 80, we can find an alternative name for Michael: ghost.
Michael is obsessed with Hamlet, so we can guess that his password will probably be something from the version of Hamlet this org is using.
So, we can create a wordlist using that info and the password policy.
I used Python to get all the unique words in Hamlet, make them lowercase, and remove any that weren't 12 characters long:

<<<CODE GOES HERE ONCE IT WORKS>>>

Using this we can head over to the login page on port 8080 and try a Hydra attack:

hydra -l ghost -P hamletwordlist.txt http-post-form://MACHINE_IP -s 8080 "/login.html:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Login failed"

Currently this returns no valid passwords for me, but it's probably a fault with my wordlist. Will return to this later and try to make Python do what I tell it to.
